## Nethunter - Mobile Penetration Testing Platform

This is a fork of kali-nethunter project, trying to port for Sony Xperia ZR, known as a dogo.


# Synopsis
To extend the capabilities of your android phone, you need to install CyanogenMod, a free community built distribution of Android, then you can use some special and unique features of Kali Linux on chroot env as Nethunter.


# Documentation 
Read official wiki on "Building NetHunter" and "Porting Kali NetHunter to New Devices"
https://github.com/offensive-security/kali-nethunter/wiki


# Installation
If you want to try it, there is a zip file named "nethunter-dogo.zip" on /release folder.
The kernel configuration is based on _Kali-nethunter wiki page_ and had some patches for rtlwifi (usb wireless adapter) and mac80211 (as recommended) modules. You can see my cm_kali_dogo_defconfig for kernel configuration. 

Howto: (*some issues*) [see references]
    1. unlocking your device and updating it to CM-12.1 [Dogo_Info CM wiki page]

(the zip file did not signed and CM recovery does not accept it!)
    2. install TWRP custom recovery for dogo or yuga [TWRP for Sony Xperia ZR]
	reboot to recovery

    3. flash the NetHunter zip file to your device, basic and 3rd-party wip apps
	reboot > System

(the Anykernel2 script create boot-new.img based on $second offset and it dosn't work on dogo! removing some lines of anykernel.sh making it unable to patch init.usb for HID USB, i'm working on it)

(if your device was on loop or unsuccessful kernel installation)
	4. power-off the device by taking battrey out, put it into fastboot/bootloader mode
	$ fastboot flash boot boot.img 

	5. run NetHunter > Kali Chroot Manager > install as minimal or full
(you have a small data partion on your dogo device, it's better to install as minimal image, and of course you can add packages in terminal or build-in app scripts)


# Supports and Issues
You must enable busybox installation on first time. Otherwise nethunter app can't find kalifs-*.tar.xz on /sdcard. After download and extraction of chroot env 

Check for successful kernel installation (kernel version: 3.4.0-cm-g9c43e6b). Otherwise do stage.4 

Monitor mode for wireless USB adapter chip based on zd1211 & zd1201 & zd100xx & rtl8192cu (like Asus USB-N13 rev. B1). For internal wcn3660, i think we need wcn36xx driver (kernel.org wiki on wcn36xx)
